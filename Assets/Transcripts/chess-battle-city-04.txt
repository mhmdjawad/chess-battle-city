Welcome to EP04 of chess battle city in javascript...
We will talk about scenes and how to manage them.

our main objective in writing a nice code is delegating tasks,
and lighten the load in the main...

scene manager will be responsible on routing between scenes
we will need to provide the event manager
because other scenes will subscribe to events

for this demo I have added 3 new files, the scene manager
and two scenes loading and main menu
I have also added a cute animation entry for the main menu
and in the loading scene I halted until the user does something
like mouse down or touch or key pressed...
this is preparation to play a sound when loading the main menu later on...maybe

regarding the loading scene, we will need to import the assets manager,
to know the percentage of loaded assets...
and the keyboard and mouse to handle events and subscribe

so once all assets loaded, the message will switch form loading to LOADING COMPLETE


and when user does interaction we will switch to the main menu scene

in this scene we display the menu, for now it is just presented by writing text on the canvas but later we will make menu item class 

the animation here is quite simple to implement but I intended it to explain these parameters in context draw image
this function can take 2, 4, or 8 parameters [in addition to image
if only 2, they are the x and y where the drawing of image will start, and it will draw it whole
if 4, they are the x,y and width,height, where you will scale the image,still will be drawn as whole...
however the 8 parameters, will be x,y,w,h -- x,y,w,h 
first x,y,w,h will be used to crop the image x,y starting position w,h the width and height
second x,y,w,h, will do as the 4 in second case...

so what I did here is divide the buffer into 2 splices, left and right
and get them closer to each other in the update function, but stop when they arrive

and in the draw, I use the 8 parameter way to crop the image for left and right
and to set position that I updated...


this will be all for this episode..
