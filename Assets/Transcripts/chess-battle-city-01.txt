Hello, and welcome to episode one of chess battle city in javascript.

In this episode, I will first show my the achievement of today, which is the bullets!
Then my second child of today is this page, here I will be adding each and every part
we will be discussing though out this tutorial, and you can check the code and notes
whenever you need.

So I have added a bit about episode 00 which just few stuff to fill blanks,
about the game, youtube tutorial link that I'll be updating after this video

but what we will go through today is Episode 01 which is about setting up files
and introducing Timer.Js, which is a small javascript class that will make our canvas alive.

so first things first we need to make a directory for our project and add the following to it
an html file index.html and a folder Assets.

Assets folder will contain all of our assets, image, scripts, styles, and later on json files or any other stuff.

we will start at the index.html page, we will be adding our files in the head
the main.css and main.js that exist in our project and plus jquery because it would help

at the body of the page we will need a container to place the canvas in it
and a callback to the main where we will call constructor of our main

as you can see we are loading main as a module type, 
this is because every other js file will be imported in the main js

I will go though this but I guess being fast here won't do harm

we create a canvas element, set its width and height as we please
add this canvas to the container in html

to draw stuff on the canvas we will need to get the 2d context of it
canvas also have a 3d context in webgl that you can try, search for threejs and check it out
I have tried it for a couple day and made this floating cube with logo on its sides
now back to our 2d game...
for this part we will just draw text Loading in the center-ish of the canvas

we can do that through these lines of code..
we fill the canvas in black
then we fill text on the center of height of canvas and center of width
now that will indicate the top corner where we will draw but that does not matter now

styling is, well, styling... 
this snippet of css will make the canvas centered and a background color set to body

now that we have our canvas and we know how to draw on it we need to make it more alive
as in we need to animate it, so I'll get to the most important topic of this episode 
the Timer.js, this is a class that will help us making the animation.
I have set it up to take an object as parameter and a frame rate, also a boolean to automate it at start

the object calling it should have update method that could take one parameter
which is the time passed since we have started the timer...

so here is an example that I have updated the previous main js to show how many seconds have passed
I also added a counter to tell how many times the main have been updated
the thing is, Timer js ensure us to make as many frames as we tell it in frame rate,
so when we want the game to go fast we can toy with the frame rate.

this would be all for this episode,
