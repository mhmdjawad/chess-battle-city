Hello, and welcome to episode two of chess battle city in javascript.

This episode I will be talking about event manager and input handling,
so 2 new javascript classes will be joining the team, EventManager.js 
and KeyboardAndMouse.js

KeyboardAndMouse will take care of adding event listeners to the target
among the list of events provided and will notify the EventManager
when any of the evets occur
EventManager will notify all subscribers to the event that was lunched
and each of them will handle it as it want.
