            This game was inspired by 2 games that have been for a long time, Chess and Battle City
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea is to have a turn playing game where each turn you can move one of your tanks,<br> 
            you win by destroying the biggest tank the enemy have

Hello, and welcome to this series where we will be making a javascript game,
which is chess battle city.

In this series, I will be walking through the steps of making a canvas game in general,
and about this game in specific, 
the logic behind and my ideas on how to make code that ease your coding.

I'll make this intro brief as possible, 
for disclosure I have started working on this project about a week ago,
I have seen a lot of github repositories but this one did me a huge favor [open github page]
I spent a whole day refactoring to ES6 in the intension first to make second player enabled, 
then I though about this game, and there we are...
I also have seen many youtube tutorials, 
most related is the Super Mario Bros in JavaScript[open tab in browser]..
I recommend watching this series it would help a lot.
now back to our project [open game tab]
at this point I have the setup done loading images, 
two scenes for now the main one you are seeing 
and the sandbox which is where I will be testing functionalities before I have a game to play.

[open photoshop]so far, I have the following javascript files,
I am using ES6 javascript and as so my main is loaded in the html using type module and the rest of js 
files are acquired using the import in each file which is pretty awesome and makes things easier 
and more fun to code.
It all began when I found this repository about battle city game in canvas, 
it has been there for 9 years waiting me and here I am, 
at first I wanted to make it two player enabled then thought about two players vs each other 
then the idea of making it a chess variant and so I started, 
I made a refactoring for the original code at first. it had 91 javascript files, 
I have converted each from variable structure into ES6 code, 
and then started working on my project and making changes all the way to suite my needs 
and make things easier, I made new images for sprites in game in photoshop 
and made new classes to handle images and sprites and make it easier to make the game, 
then I started with the basic stuff line the intro menu and making tanks, 
and two days ago I actually started working on the game itself, 
I still have a long way to go, many logic to implement, but as things will go deeper, 
it will began harder to document, 
so I decided to start making theses videos so that I won't get lazy later

It may be hard, I even think that making these videos would be harder than coding the actual game, 
but I will try my best to keep things here simple and deliver beneficial information.
